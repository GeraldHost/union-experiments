Next step would be to investigate if we could reduce the range of an outlier. While I can't see a path for making the range of `borrow_amount` smaller, it is clear that you could reduce the range of `repaid_delta` by forcing people to call `writeOff` on loans that have gone outside a certain `repaid_delta` range."
